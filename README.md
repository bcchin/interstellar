# Interstellar: A Journey Through Space!
## A Java Scrolling Game
#### About
Interstellar is an interactive, multilevel scrolling game that takes the player on a virtual journey through space!
Using arrow keys, the player navigates a rocket ship through outer space, collecting stars along the way to increase their score and avoiding meteorites to stay alive. Given only one shot, the player must survive three levels, with meteorites traveling progressively faster through space each time, before reaching Planet Earth and winning the game!
